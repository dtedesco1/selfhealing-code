Curious weekend experiment building scripts that use OpenAI models to fix their own errors.

Run the [main.py](selfheal-py-2/main.py) file and watch GPT do it's work.

Create your own challenges by editing `user_input`, or get the bot to invent novel challenges for itself with the generate_input()` function.

Open for contributions!
