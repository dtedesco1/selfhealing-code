Sure, here's a plan for downloading and storing one real cat meme locally:

1. Import the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, and the `os` library to handle file operations.
2. Get the URL of a real cat meme. This can be performed by searching online or by navigating to a cat meme website and inspecting the source code to find the URL of one of the images.
3. Make a GET request to the cat meme URL using the `requests.get()` function.
4. Check that the response status code is 200, indicating success. If not, raise an error and exit the program.
5. Extract the content of the response using the `response.content` attribute.
6. Create a new file with a .jpg extension in the current working directory using the `open()` function.
7. Write the image content to the file using the `write()` method.
8. Close the file using the `close()` method.
9. Print a success message to the console indicating that the image was downloaded and stored locally.

Here's some pseudocode to help clarify the steps:

```
import requests
import os

# Step 1: Import necessary libraries

# Step 2: Get the URL of a real cat meme

# Step 3: Make a GET request to the cat meme URL
response = requests.get(cat_meme_url)

# Step 4: Check the response status code
if response.status_code != 200:
    raise ValueError("Failed to download cat meme")

# Step 5: Extract the content of the response
image_content = response.content

# Step 6: Create a new file with a .jpg extension
with open("cat_meme.jpg", "wb") as f:
    # Step 7: Write the image content to the file
    f.write(image_content)

# Step 8: Close the file
f.close()

# Step 9: Print a success message
print("Cat meme downloaded and stored locally!")
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
