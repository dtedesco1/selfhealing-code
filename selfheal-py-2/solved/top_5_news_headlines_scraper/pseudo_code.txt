To fix the error and meet the user's requirements, follow these steps:

1. First, the error "name 'patch' is not defined" is caused by not importing 'call' and 'patch' from the 'unittest.mock' module. You should update the import statement to include these two names.

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, call
```

2. Since the user mentioned that they don't want to use any API keys and want to scrape a reputable news website, we can choose a news website like CNN, BBC News, or any other well-known source. For this example, let's choose BBC News. Update the 'scrape_top_headlines()' function to use the appropriate URL and update the BeautifulSoup selector to fetch the headlines and URLs correctly.

3. Modify the test cases to reflect the changes made in the scraping function. Update the mocked response content to match the structure of the chosen news website, and adjust the test cases accordingly.

Here's the updated plan in pseudocode:

```
1. Import required names from unittest.mock
   from unittest.mock import patch, call

2. Update the 'scrape_top_headlines()' function
   - Change the URL to a reputable news website (e.g., BBC News)
   - Update the BeautifulSoup selector to fetch headlines and URLs correctly.

3. Modify the test cases in 'TestScraper' class
   - Update the mocked response content to match the structure of the chosen news website.
   - Adjust the test cases to work with the updated 'scrape_top_headlines()' function.

4. Run the test cases to ensure the code works as expected.
```

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the error and meet the user's requirements.
