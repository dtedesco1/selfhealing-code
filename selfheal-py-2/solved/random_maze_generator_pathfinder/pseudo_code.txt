To fix the given error and meet the user requirements, I suggest the following changes in pseudocode:

1. Ensure that the necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the script:
   - Import random
   - Import heapq

2. Correctly define the main function:
   a. Prompt the user for the size of the maze (n) and convert it to an integer
   b. Call the generate_maze function with n as the argument to create the maze
   c. Identify the start and end points of the maze by iterating through the generated maze and finding the coordinates with 'S' and 'E' values.
   d. Call the a_star_search function with the generated maze, start, and end points as arguments to find the shortest path.
   e. Update the maze with the shortest path by marking the path with '*' symbols.
   f. Print the updated maze.

3. Add a conditional statement at the end of the script to call the main function only if the script is executed directly:
   - if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()

By following these steps, the code should work as intended and generate a random maze with the shortest path from the start to the end point.
