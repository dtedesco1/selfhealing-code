1. Use the `requests` library to retrieve the text of the Wikipedia page for the International Space Station.
2. Create an empty dictionary to store the letter counts.
3. Loop through each character in the text and update the count in the dictionary if the character is a letter.
4. Use the `matplotlib` library to create a histogram of the letter counts.
5. Save the histogram to a local file using the `savefig` function.
