I apologize for the confusion. Here's a simple code snippet that you can write tests for:

```
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
```

Test code:

```
def test_add_numbers():
    assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5
    assert add_numbers(-2, 3) == 1
    assert add_numbers(0, 0) == 0
    assert add_numbers(1.5, 2.5) == 4.0
```

Note: Please make sure to import the `add_numbers` function from the `output` module in your test file.
