# Selfhealing Code Quickstart

This is a quickstart guide to get you started with selfhealing code. It is based on the content of this repo.

## What is selfhealing code?

Selfhealing code is a way to write code that can recover from errors. It is based on the idea that code should be able to recover from errors and that it should be able to do so without human intervention. This is a very powerful concept that can be used to build systems that are more reliable and more resilient.

## How do I get started?

The first step is to download this repo:


# Selfhealing Code w/ GPT-4 (or 3)

Curious weekend experiment building scripts that use OpenAI models to fix their own errors.

Run the [main.py](selfheal-py-2/main.py) file and watch GPT do it's work.

Create your own challenges by editing `user_input`, or get the bot to invent novel challenges for itself with the `generate_input()` function.
